# AES

AES comes in different flavors whose distinction is the _size of the
key_: 128, 192, or 256 bits.

Before [[en|de]]cryption, keys are expanded into "round keys", leaving
the only difference between AES-[[128|192|256]] to be the **number of
rounds**:

* 128 bits has **10 rounds**
* 192 bits has **12 rounds**
* 256 bits has **14 rounds**
