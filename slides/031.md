What is meant by "round"?

Each round has 4 transformations: `SubBytes`, `ShiftRows`,
`MixColumns`, and `AddRoundKey`. The algorithm runs each of these
transformations on the 16-byte `state` block for $n$ rounds.

```haskell
round :: [Word32] -> [Word32] -> [Word32]
round rk = addRoundKey rk . mixColumns . shiftRows . subBytes

roundLast :: [Word32] -> [Word32] -> [Word32]
roundLast rk = addRoundKey rk . shiftRows . subBytes

encrypt_ :: [Word32] -> [Word32] -> [Word32]
encrypt_ plain expandedKey =
  go (addRoundKey (take 4 expandedKey)
     (matrify plain)) (drop 4 expandedKey) 1
  where
    go :: [Word32] -> [Word32] -> Int -> [Word32]
    go state ek 14 = matrify $ roundLast ek state
    go state ek i = go (round (take 4 ek) state) (drop 4 ek) (i + 1)
```
