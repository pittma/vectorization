# Vectorization 101

**Vectorization** is the idea of creating a "vector" of data from a
set of scalars, and then using Same Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
to do a computation on the elements of that vector in parallel.

* A **scalar** is a solitary unit of data, typically a number, say
  $7$.
* While a **vector** is collection of scalars:

<center>
$$
\mathbf{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
7 \\
7 \\
7 \\
7
\end{bmatrix}
$$
</center>
